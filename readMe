🛡️ Log-Guard: Hybrid AI Log Classifier

Bridging Rule-Based Precision with Semantic Intelligence

📖 Overview

Log-Guard is a hybrid log classification system designed to process and categorize system logs efficiently at scale.

Traditional log monitoring systems rely either on:

Regex-based rules (fast but rigid), or

AI models (flexible but computationally expensive).

Log-Guard combines the strengths of both approaches using a dual-layer hybrid pipeline:

Regex Engine (The Guard) – Instantly detects predefined structured log patterns.

AI Semantic Engine (The Brain) – Classifies semantically similar logs using sentence embeddings and machine learning when rules fail.

This architecture ensures both high speed and semantic intelligence.

🧠 Hybrid Classification Pipeline
🔹 Layer 1: Regex Engine (Priority Matching)

Identifies 14+ predefined log categories

Covers common structured logs:

Login Events

Backup Operations

Web Errors

System Warnings

Near 100% precision on known patterns

Extremely fast and computationally lightweight

If a log matches a known pattern, classification is immediate.

🔹 Layer 2: AI Semantic Engine (Fallback Intelligence)

If the log does not match any regex rule:

The log text is converted into a 384-dimensional embedding vector using SBERT.

The embedding is passed to a Logistic Regression classifier trained on semantic categories.

The model predicts the most relevant category.

This enables semantic understanding such as:

“Database connection timed out”

“DB refused connection”

Both are recognized as the same intent.

✨ Key Features

✅ Dual-layer hybrid architecture

✅ Semantic understanding using SBERT embeddings

✅ Logistic Regression classifier for efficient inference

✅ Real-time interactive dashboard using Streamlit

✅ t-SNE visualization for semantic cluster mapping

✅ Zero-shot fallback handling for unknown logs
